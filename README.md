Cybersecurity focuses on protection of computer systems from unauthorized access from unathurozied personels.
# WEEK 1:
**Deploying of a networked Sandbox**: In computer security and architecture A sandboxed network is a network environment that is isolated from the rest of the network and is often used for testing, running potentially malicious code, or conducting experiments without risking harm to the main network or systems. Machines neeeded for this task are *Ubuntu gateway 22.04, Ubuntu wordpress 14.04 and 22.04, kali linux and windows Iso file.* All these machines will be deployed in a virtual box (An popular open-source virtualization software developed by Oracle that allows you to create and run virtual machines (VMs) on your computer) in order to achieve the image below
